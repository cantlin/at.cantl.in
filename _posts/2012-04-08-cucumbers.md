title: Cucumbers and Just Smoked Cigarettes

The aromas of cucumbers and just smoked cigarettes followed them in, bringing round my nicotine starved senses. I looked three times at the man. His features were small, intricate and symmetrical, like an ex-presenter of children's television, stubbly, well touched by age. The cucumbers must have come from her perfume, spread wide as she rustled and arched this way and that in lively discourse with the maitre d'. Seated, she spoke quietly in a soft American accent, and I imagined they must have come from L.A., where every man and woman is beautiful and brittle and disloyal, or at any rate California somewhere. I rolled the taste of stale tobacco around my mouth, ordered another coffee. It was Easter Sunday, 2012, and I was not yet anything at all.
