I serve sausage, and when I serve sausage I am vengeful.

A little less sausage for this man,<br />
who clothes himself so handsomely.<br />
Less sausage for this man,<br />
with his milky, maudlin eyes.<br />

More sausage for this man who is patient.<br />
Who trembled when he ordered and has counted<br />
out the money in his pocket in advance and<br />
who is going nowhere, that I can tell,<br />
in particular.<br />

For this man the greasy runt, too.<br />
Fried deep, overflowing its skin, added to the regular helping<br />
like a grizzled, stunted addendum.<br />

No sausage for me.<br />
I would choke and puke on it.<br />
Squirm and choke and puke on it.<br />
Behind the vans,<br />
by the wire fences,<br />
where it is still and quiet but for me.<br />
