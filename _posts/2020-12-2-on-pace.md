The goal of allocating resources in a company is to maximise efficiency by synchronising the pace of its processes. In a product team, for example, we want to be working out what to build at roughly the same speed as we are building it. If we work out what to build too slowly, we will end up building from guesswork. In contrast, if we build too slowly, we will create a large stock of blueprints that never return the cost of creating them.

The product team example shows a system with opposing interactions on a stock â€“ in this case the stock of things worth building. Another example is retail stores that need to receive from the warehouse as many products as are bought by customers.

Both product teams and retail stores continually try to balance their supply of a certain stock. When customer demand changes, a store might alter its order from the warehouse. If a product team finds itself without enough great ideas to build, it will turn more of its effort over to discovering new ones. In this sense, both are self optimising systems.

A key job of management in companies with product teams is to mitigate the limits of this self optimisation. For instance, a product team cannot usually assign itself more staff. It also can't change the size of the shared service teams around it, like site reliability engineering or customer research operations.

Reasoning about the balance of these investments is non-trivial, because it requires an assessment not just of the quantity of the output of each constituent process, but also its quality. In other words, it is not enough for us to be doing a lot of discovery, the discovery must also be good.

The terminology of _stocks_ and _flows_ is explored in depth in Donella H. Meadows' classic book "[Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thinking+in+systems)." Two stocks that are often important to us in product development are the stock of things we have built â€“ our product â€“ and the things we plan to build â€“ our backlog.

An important characteristic of both of these stocks is that they reflect our company's goals at the time they were created. If our goals change, there's no guarantee the stock will remain valid. This happens all the time, and for good reason. Changing the product is often the aim of changing the goals.

This helps us explain the inherent danger in long periods of discovery focus. They may generate a valuable stock â€“ blueprints for what to build â€“ but the value of that stock is contingent on it being delivered one day. The longer it sits on the shelf waiting to be delivered, the more likely it is that a change in our goals will force us to write-down our investment in creating it.
