We now live in a world where, by and large, organisations do not give orders. They have come, mostly, to a philosophical position which says that it is better for people to define their own tasks. Those who take this position (me included) believe better things happen when people work out what to do themselves, instead of being told.

But this creates a coordination problem for the system: if everyone is self-directed, how do we ensure everyone’s work is complimentary?

The answer is: by ensuring they have a common understanding of what is important.

Product management is the art of building common understanding of what is important. This common understanding forms the decision context in which people, teams and teams-of-teams make decisions about how to spend their time.

“What is important” isn’t just metrics. It includes the company’s thesis for where it will play and how it will win. It includes the definition of what “winning” means. And it describes the steps that will be taken – the plan followed – to realise that thesis.

This is often not the reality of product management. There are lots of failure modes. For example, PMs often take decisions for their team, using their internal model of what is important. But their real job is to facilitate a shared mental model powerful enough to replace their role as a decision maker.

One person knowing what to do is brittle. A shared model for what to do is resilient and scalable. And it encourages the joyful human experience of making something together.

Sharing an understanding of what is important doesn’t completely solve the coordination problem. It helps a lot, because given shared goals people tend to self organise to meet them. But we also have a lot of evidence about the best way to organise.

These operating models are more important than they get credit for. Product management itself is only a slice of one particular operating model. Even so, few organisiations have systematised their documentation and teaching. "Product operations," as some people are calling it, may well be the next frontier.
