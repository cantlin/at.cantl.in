A while ago, we found this old door a few streets away.

It was out of square (corners weren't right angles), out of plumb (vertically twisted) and didn't fit our opening. The finish was flaking and the grain was open from years of neglect. It was splattered with specks of plaster from careless renovations.

But still, we persevered.

Yesterday, we put the final coat of paint on, buffed up the brass and cleaned the windows. It's finished.

There are a lot of things I like about this door. The thing I like most about it though is that there is no other door exactly like it in the world.

I am an amateur woodworker, and I've always been inspired by the idea of the carpenter's house. This is a house that is full of things that you cannot buy. Things that were made exactly for the situation in which they now sit, and made for exactly the people that use them.

The carpenter's house is inherently unscalabeable. Every object in the carpenter's house was 100% marginal cost. To create it again will cost the same as making it the first time. The carpenter's house does not benefit from economies of scale.

The carpenter's house is made for as few people as possible. Every object in the carpenter's house was made just for the people that live there, and those that visit.

The carpenter's house is an act of making, not of buying. It is a museum to the days spent making it. It states that you cannot seperate an object from the process that made it.
