What do you see when you hear the word "strategy"? A chess board? An airforce [plotter table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotter_(RAF))? A McKinsey consultant gesturing vaguely at a quadrant on a flipchart?

We sometimes say that strategy "cascades." We visualise it as flowing down from the top, or even being pushed downward into organisations. Strategy, to most people, is "top-down" thinking.

This is the wrong framing. Strategy actually should be *pulled* out. Each autonomous unit ‚Äì a team, a tribe, a company ‚Äì should demand enough strategic rationale to do its job effectively.

Decision-context is everything you need to put on the table as a group before you make the call. One part of this context is about your immediate situation. At the team level, for example, we might ask how customers use our product today, the possible vectors for improvement, the costs of different types of changes.

The other part of decision-context is helps us understand our place in the plan. What is the strategy? Why does this team exist? Why does this tribe exist? Why does this org exist?

The rest of your decision-context is made up of information specific to the problem at hand. How customers use our product today, the possible vectors for improvement, the costs of different types of changes. But the richness of this information won't help you if you don't deeply understand what you are there to achieve.








Decisions, decisions. You can't win. Either no one seems to want to make any, or else they're all made for you.

They're the litmus test of collaboration ‚Äì the moment when a great conversation has to become great action. Maybe the moment you find out if you were all talking in the same language, after all.

Some decisions shape entire companies. What market to pursue, or what customer segment to address first? Others just shape a few pixels. The design of your website favicon, or whether your shopping list is called a ‚Äúcart‚Äù or a ‚Äúbasket.‚Äù

You can decompose what makes up a decision, if that's the kind of weird person you are. It turns out they're a lot like court judgements. There's the output, which is like the ruling. Something like ‚Äúthe button will be green.‚Äù Then there is the argument in favour of that output, like ‚Äúall the other buttons in our product that indicate user acceptance are green.‚Äù And then there's the information around that decision, which is kind of like a combination of the evidence and the laws on the statute book.

So we have two types of information that surround decisions. One is about the specifics of what we need to decide. For example, how customers use our product today, the possible vectors for improvement, the costs of different types of changes.

The other type of information is about the prior decisions that have led us here. For example, what market are we addressing? What opportunities are set out in our strategy, and how does our work address those opportunities? What are the arguments for these decisions and what information do they draw on?

Often, most of the information you need to know to make a decision is about what decisions have already been made. If you are in a job, at some point that job was created, and there was a rationale for its existence. If you're lucky, it's one that's actively cared about and maintained. If you're not, you will find yourself working with your company to update that rationale. Because without it, how would you understand how to be good?

If you are on a team, a decision is being taken every day for that team to continue to exist. That decision is taken by someone (even who gets to make that decision is the result of ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì a decision). You know its output, which is that the team is here and you're on it. You had better understand the arguments and the information, too.

If you are a leader leading many teams, your decisions now form the decision-context for each of them. This is a high-leverage setting, because making bad decisions will cause many teams to make bad decisions. You had better thoroughly understand the output ‚Äì probably a product or business strategy ‚Äì as well as the arguments and the information relating to your own decision-context.

Organisations often seek to become non-hierarchichal, promoting empowerment and autonomony in individuals and teams. This is very effective. The problem is that it does not free them from the hierarchical nature of ideas. Many teams working in alignment and synergy requires that they share a great deal of their decision-context.
