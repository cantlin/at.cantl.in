If your org can't teach new folks, then you have no option but to hire primarily for a candidate's skills. And your candidate pool is just those with enough skills already.

But if you teach your org to teach, you can hire primarily for diversity, empathy, openness – whatever you value. And your candidate pool is those who exhibit those values.

Even better: teach your org to teach your values, too. Now your candidate pool is everyone.
