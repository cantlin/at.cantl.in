We rode out of town on push bikes,<br />
turned off the tow path into dense bramble.<br />
Passed the failing canal locks north of the industrial estate,<br />
and all their decaying timbers,<br />
all that splintered wood in stagnant water.

I watched the hem of your dress ride up and down your knees,<br />
dreamed sticky sweet drying soda dreams, tacky to touch, congealing in the air.

We passed three Poles trout fishing in a Lee tributory,<br />
the tinny sound of music on a mobile phone.<br />
Tins of beer in hand,<br />
one of them gleefully pissing.

These years will recede like cliffs,<br />
drop their churches into the ocean.<br />
These moments are gravel in the tide.
